# Balancing Binary Trees & Graphs

In our last lesson, we heard about the efficiency and power of binary trees. But, similar to us humans, binary trees are only at their best when things are balanced. In this lesson, we’ll learn about how to unlock the power of binary trees by balancing them!

We will also cover Graphs. Graphs are your favorite data structure that you (maybe) didn’t even know about. They power social media, maps, and more! We’ll also learn the basics of the graph data structure and how they’re implemented.

These two modules conclude the Computer Science modules included in the myGA Learning Path, but this is just the beginning of your journey into Computer Science fundamentals! After the end of the course, feel free to return to these modules to review and reflect at your own pace to prepare for technical interviews. Many developers also use [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://ahmed-badawy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cracking-the-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition-189-Programming-Questions-and-Solutions.pdf) to help them prep for the technical interview and whiteboarding challenges. 

## Learning Objectives

**Balancing Binary Trees:**

- Distinguish between a balanced and an unbalanced binary tree.
- Explain how an AVL tree balances itself.
- Balance a binary tree.

**Graphs:**

- Define a graph and understand the difference between undirected and directed graphs.
- Identify how graphs are used in programming.
- Implement a graph using an adjacency list.

## Prerequisites: 
* Binary Trees

## Activity

There are two components to this lesson: 
1. myGA module on [Balancing Binary Trees](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/263)
2. myGA module on [Graphs](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/403)

**To do the in-class exercises, you can either...* 

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine and work in the relevant files.
1. Use [this codepen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/bZGMaQ?editors=0010#0) provided by the myGA Balancing Binary Trees module, and [this codepen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/JzjvvE?editors=0010#0) for the Graph exercise.
1. Regardless of which way you choose, the exercises are the same (but the codepen has testing).
