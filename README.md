# Balancing Binary Trees

In our last lesson, we heard about the efficiency and power of binary trees. But, similar to us humans, binary trees are only at their best when things are balanced. In this lesson, weâ€™ll learn about how to unlock the power of binary trees by balancing them!

## Homework Instructions 

Complete the activity as outlined below. When you are finished, submit an an issue answering the exit ticket questions to summarize your learning on this topic! 

Unless otherwise stated, homework is due by 10:00 am ET the next morning.

## Learning Objectives

**Balancing Binary Trees:**

- Distinguish between a balanced and an unbalanced binary tree.
- Explain how an AVL tree balances itself.
- Balance a binary tree.

## Prerequisites: 
* Binary Trees

## Activity

There are two components to this lesson: 
1. myGA module on [Balancing Binary Trees](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/263)
2. In-class exercise implementing an AVL Tree

**To do the in-class exercises, you can either...** 

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine and work in the relevant files.
1. Use [this codepen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/bZGMaQ?editors=0010#0) provided by the myGA Balancing Binary Trees module
1. Regardless of which way you choose, the exercises are the same (but the codepen has testing).
