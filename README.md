# Balancing Binary Trees & Graphs

In our last lesson, we heard about the efficiency and power of binary trees. But, similar to us humans, binary trees are only at their best when things are balanced. In this lesson, we’ll learn about how to unlock the power of binary trees by balancing them!

We will also cover Graphs. 

## Learning Objectives

**Balancing Binary Trees:**

- Distinguish between a balanced and an unbalanced binary tree.
- Explain how an AVL tree balances itself.
- Balance a binary tree.

**Graphs:**

- 

## Prerequisites: 
* Binary Trees

## Activity

There are two components to this lesson: 
1. 
2. 

**To do the in-class exercises, you can either...* 

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine and work in the relevant files
1. Use [this codepen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/bZGMaQ?editors=0010#0) provided by the myGA Balancing Binary Trees module
1. Regardless of which way you choose, the exercises are the same (but the codepen has testing)
